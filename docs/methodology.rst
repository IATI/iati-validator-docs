IATI Validation Methodology
===========================

Validation is the process of assessing a file using the IATI standards and guidance. The result of this process is a report.

If there are no errors or ways in which the file varies from the IATI standards and guidance, then the report will show "Success". 

Otherwise, notifications will be shown at one or more of the following severity levels: Critical, Warning, Error or Information. 

Critical 
--------

Critical notifications are generated by validating the file against the XML Schema for the Activity or Organisation standard, as appropriate. 

Any schema validation error will result in a Critical status being shown. 

Typically, Critical notifications relate to file format, mandatory fields, and data types. 

Critical notifications mean that tools that expect to make use of the data cannot do so, because it doesn't use the expected format.

Error & Warning
---------------

Error and Warning notifications are generated by applying the IATI Standard Rulesets to the file. The Rulesets describe rules for IATI data that cannot be expressed in XML Schema.

If the rule states that a certain condition MUST be met, then failure to meet that condition results in an Error notification. 

If the rule states that a certain condition SHOULD be met, then failure to meet that condition results in a Warning notification. 

Information
-----------

Information notifications provide assessments of a file that have an impact on the utility of the file as part of the wider IATI ecosystem.
