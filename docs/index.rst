IATI Validator
**************

The IATI Validator is a tool for assessing data using the rules and guidance of the IATI Standard. It also provides information on how to improve the quality of IATI data to ensure it is accessible and useful to anyone working with data on development and humanitarian activities, resources and results.

Files can be uploaded to the Validator for assessment via `the Validator website <https://validator.iatistandard.org>`_ . Validation usually takes a few minutes.

A link to data on the Web can be provided, and the IATI Validator will download the file before assessing it. This relies on the data being publicly available: advice on identifying and resolving download issues can be found on the `IATI Standard Website <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/publishing-data/publishing-files/publishing-without-access-restrictions/>`_.  

Reports on any published IATI file can be found in the `Public Data Viewer <https://validator.iatistandard.org/organisations>`_. Reports are available a few hours after the data has been updated. 

Validation and reports are also available via the `IATI API Portal <https://developer.iatistandard.org/api-details#api=iati-validator-v2&operation=get-pub-get-report>`_. 

The methodology used by the Validator and the meaning of the reports can be found in the :ref:`IATI Validation<Validation Overview>` section.

Donor Requirements
------------------

A number of donors have their own requirements for their grantees; the IATI Validator does not check for these. For assistance, contact the relevant donor. IATI does publish `donor reporting requirement guidance <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/standard-overview/donors-reporting-requirements/>`_ , which represents IATI's most current information.
