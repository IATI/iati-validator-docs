Workspaces
==========

When you use the Check Data function on the IATI Validator, a personal workspace is created for you. You can record the link in your browser's address bar, and return to it later to carry on your work. You can also share the link with others to allow them to see the validation results.  

Workspaces will be deleted periodically for maintenance. There is no fixed schedule for this, but you should not rely on them existing forever. 

Workspaces can contain a maximum of 25 files. Individual files cannot be removed from a workspace, but the workspace can be cleared with the Clear Workspace button. 

You can start a new workspace by opening the IATI Validator in a different browser, or using the private browsing mode of your browser. 

.. note:: 
    When you provide the URL of file, the workspace stores the validation results for the moment that you used the Check Data function. In order to check the file again, you should use the Check Data function again.
