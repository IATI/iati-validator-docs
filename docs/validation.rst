Validation Overview
###################

Validation is the process of assessing a file using the `IATI Standard <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/>`_. Both the schema and the rulesets are used in validation. 

Validation only covers areas of the standard that can be checked by a computer: some requirements of the IATI standard (such as that text is descriptive) are subjective and therefore are not included in validation. 

Validation only checks the structure of the data: no attempt is made to verify that the data is true or accurate. 

The result of this process is a report, which shows the :ref:`status<Statuses>` of the file, and details of any issues found. Issues are grouped into :ref:`categories<Categories>` for ease of comprehension.
